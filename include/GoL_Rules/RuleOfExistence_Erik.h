- If such a cell would then survive another set amount of generations, it will be marked with a value of **E**.
- In the extreme case, where the cell has achieved above requirements and is determined to be the oldest living cell, it will
become a **prime elder**, and have its color changed once again. A generation may only have one such elder.
