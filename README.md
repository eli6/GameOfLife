# Tests and Documentation for Game Of Life.

Fork of GameOfLife project adding tests and documentation for the project. This main page is the same as the Bitbucket README to avoid duplicating the information there.

Doxygen files for generation of documentation are in folder "docs". Test files are in the folder "test". The other folders contain the code for GameOfLife.

## Requirements

No specific requirements

## Getting Started

###Read Documentation

Clone the repo, first enter folder "docs"

```
cd docs
```
Then, from the docs folder: generate the Doxygen code, enter the html folder and open the index.html file to see it, this can be shortened to the following command:

```
doxygen Doxyfile && cd html && open index.html
```

Now you can read everything about GameOfLife!

Run the executable GameOfLife-test in cmake-build-debug folder (or compile with GameOfLife-test-configuration) to run the tests.
