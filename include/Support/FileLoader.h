     * with a try-catch block. An ios_base::failure exception is thrown if unsuccessful. If not,
     * the world dimensions are read from file and used to create a population of cells.

     * @test 1) That the file is opened when a correct filename is used 2) That an exception
     * is thrown when not 3) That the correct world size is read 4) That a population of cells is created.
     *  @bug Uncaught exception when using an incorrect seed file.
     *  @bug Creates a cell population that is 2 cells too wide and 2 cells too high. Cell at point 19,9 is not a rim cell as expected. Change in if clause so that values between 0 and WORLD_DIMENSIONS.HEIGHT/WIDTH - 1 instead of +1 is used.
     *  @bug Row 0 is also read from file although it contains rim cells, since that line isn't explicitly removed or skipped. It also reads a total of 10 rows starting from 0, and not 9 whiuch was expected, since WORLD_DIMENSIONS.HEIGHT+1 instead of -1 is used.
     *  @bug " char cellState = iss.get();" gets the 0 at the start of the row and creates a dead cell, but that is a rimCell and should be skipped
